# Smart Queue System üöÄ
**Smart Queue System** is a lightweight, real-time web application designed to replace paper-based queuing systems. It's perfect for small businesses like clinics, restaurants, or barber shops to manage customer flow efficiently without requiring customers to wait in line.

Customers can scan a QR code, get a queue number on their phone, and track their status in real-time. Admins get a simple dashboard to call and manage the queue instantly.

**Live Demo:** [**smart-queue.your-domain.com**](https://smart-queue-system-sepia.vercel.app/)  
**Live API:** [**smart-queue-api.onrender.com**](https://smart-queue-backend-gc5v.onrender.com)
